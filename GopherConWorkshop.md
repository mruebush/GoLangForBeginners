# GopherCon Workshop Schedule

The goal of the workshop will be to develop a **Quotes Engine** for the beginning engineer to display their favorite quotes and inspirations in their terminal. This will start with a deep dive into their workspace and how a program communicates with their computer and outside world. It will then continue with the engineer learning about variables, strings, conditionals, loops, and standard input and output to manage their quotes. At the end, additional exercises will be provided for the engineer to do after the workshop. Finally, the engineers will be introduced to their GopherCon buddies for the rest of the week before heading to the evening happy hour.

## Morning (9am - 12pm)
The morning goal is to immerse the attendees in why programming is so interesting and powerful. While many new programmers have been told "everyone needs to learn to code!" there are not often explanations for why they should. Throughout the morning we will go over how many of the internal components involved with programming work together and get them excited about what projects they could build in the future using Go.

### Topics To Be Covered
- File Systems (15 minutes)
    - show what they are (for people that have only worked on cloud based services)
    - use the terminology of "read" and "write" when reviewing a file - use cat to show the contents
    - use a file with a list of quotes in it (to set up the example that will be used throughout the day)
- Terminal (30 minutes)
    - what it is
    - how do the commands you type actually change your computer (ex of moving files)
    - maybe explain a bit of networking? ping a website? curl an API that returns a list of quotes?
- Installing Go (30 minutes)
    - what is a PATH and why do you have to bother with it
    - why does Go tell you where to put things (analogy to a disorganized folder system)
- DevOps (too much?) (30 minutes)
    - go build vs go install
    - what is a binary / why is it useful 
    - show example for windows vs mac 
        - compare to running code in another environments (Rails)
- Hello World in Go (30 minutes)
    - download VS Code and get Hello World running
- Fun Project Examples (30 minutes)

------------------------

## Afternoon (1pm - 4pm)
In the afternoon, they will start their Quote Engine. This will get them from zero to feeling comfortable with the basics of the Go programming language. This should empower them to continue exploring the language, talk about the language with others throughout the conference, and continue building on their own after the workshop.

Project Concept: A command line tool that returns back a random quote from a list stored in memory

### Topics To Be Covered (really unsure about how long it will take to cover these topics...)
- Variables (30 minutes)
    - print out a string 
    - number manipulation 
    - print out string information, count the words in the quote
- Standard Input & Output (45 minutes)
    - explain what standard output is 
    - add in an argument that asks to return a quote
- Conditionals (30 minutes)
    - add in an argument to ask for a short vs long quote 
- Loops (30 minutes)
    - randomly return a quote from a list 
- Writing a Test (30 minutes)

------------------------

## End of Workshop (4pm - 5pm)

Show examples of additional features that the new engineer could work on now that they have started! Encourage them to work on it throughout the week and use us as a resource for if they get stuck.

### Feature ideas:
- read from the original file we showed them
- show a new quote every time you open your terminal or a new tab
- integrate with an API that will pull new quotes from somewhere else

Finally, we will introduce the new gophers to their GopherCon buddies for the rest of the week. This will allow for an easy meeting point for the new and experienced gophers to find each other, and start off an easy segway into the GopherCon happy hour after the workshop. Aside from the new friends that they have in the room, this will give them an experienced engineer to reach out to throughout the conference.

------------------------

After the workshop, our goal is to keep up with the attendees throughout the event! We will find them during lunches, meet up with them at the start of Community Day to help them find projects or meet people from around the community.
