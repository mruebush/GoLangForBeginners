### Talk Details

**Title**: Introduction to Go Programming for Debutantes

**Abstract** 300 chars: 
Introduction to Go Programming designed for people with little to no programming experience or those updating skills and have not been programming for a while. We are taking a workflow based approach that will teach proper software craftsmanship along with the basics of the Go programming language so you know how to actually create, build and deploy. There is also a focus on breaking down problems into chunks that can be built and will even help get an editor set up and techniques to be more efficient. 

**Talk Format**: Workshop

**Audience Level**: Beginner

**Description**: (schedule)
*The description will be seen by reviewers during the CFP process and may eventually be seen by the attendees of the event.*
*You should make the description of your talk as compelling and exciting as possible. Remember, you're selling both the organizers of the events to select your talk, as well as trying to convince attendees your talk is the one they should see.*
Go is a simple, straight forward and opinionated language that we believe would be a great entry drug into software development. Our intention is that no matter your background or goals that this will be a safe and productive way to get introduced to software engineering. This is part of a longer course that we have built around educating anybody on the basics of software development using Go. We want to cement a repetitive workflow into the participants minds so that they have the mental and software tools do projects and solve problems using Go and feeling productive and successful as soon as possible. This will hopefully lead to exploration of more advanced topics and getting further into software development with Go, building on the basic skills that they have acquired.

**Notes**: (mention)
*Notes will only be seen by reviewers during the CFP process. This is where you should explain things such as technical requirements, why you're the best person to speak on this subject, etc...*
Mitch and Kaylyn are part of the Capital One Tech College which is learning hub inside Capital One. The Tech College is about educating technical and non-technical people around technology and the how to deliver digital products and to rapidly scaling the breadth, depth and capabilities of learning at Capital One. We currate content, build tools and create courses to create an excellent learning experience and maximize the opportunity to progress in our rapidly changing company and the world. We work with people from the sales associate or operations person that would like to get into software development to non technical and technical executives who need to understand technology better to the well-known experts in given technologies and provide them with the appropriate level of training.

Kaylyn and Mitch have been programming in Go for a few years and have fallen in love with its simplicity. We are passionate about education and giving people the tools they need to pursue greater opportunities or to make something happen. 

We would also be interested in to help offer some diversity scholarships for GopherCon as part of Capital One for people that are interested in learning Go and also attending this workshop from communities that would not have the opportunities to attend GopherCon or a workshop like this. We would also like to provide a "recommended" curriculum for GopherCon for topics that would be good for those that are new to programming and Go. We would really like to see this curriculum be available to the community and anyone to be able to
